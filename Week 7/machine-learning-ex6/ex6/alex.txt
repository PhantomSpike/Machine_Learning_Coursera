Hi Carina and Andrew,
Happy Easter!

Not sure which one of you is in charge fo this so I am emailing both of you.
I am currently a PhD student in the King group at DPAG (Sherrington). I am also a Micron user here at Biochemistry and the Dunn school.
For some reason my Biochem account has expeired even though I am active user so when I came today for my booking I couldn't use it. It must have went to my spam folder so I haven't noticed.
Can I please ask for your help in extending my Biochem account so I can keep using the FV 3000? According to John Elder:

ÿ (a) if you are a member of staff or a visitor, please
ÿ ask your Biochemistry group leader (or the Micron staff if you are
ÿ an external Micron user) to arrange with Biochemistry administration
ÿ (not IT Support) for your leaving date to be amended;
Do you think you would be able to email/talk to the relevant people and get me back on the system as soon as possible? I really needed to use the microscope and this is a bit frustrating. I can use the ones in Pathology for now but it would be great if I can get back on the system in Biochem. 
Thank you for your help and sorry for any incovenience.
Best wishes,
Alex
